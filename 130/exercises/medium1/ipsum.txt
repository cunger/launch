I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? How long can two people talk about nothing?

I guess it's better to be lucky than good.

- I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.
- I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.
- You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.
- Wouldn't that bring about chaos?

Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.

The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. What? We're not at all alike! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Travel time to the nearest starbase? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. This should be interesting.

Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? You enjoyed that. Your shields were failing, sir. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Ensign Babyface! The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet.

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Besides, you look good in a dress.
