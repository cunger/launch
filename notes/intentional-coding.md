# Rule \#1: Have a plan.

**Understand the problem**. Make sure to really, properly understand the problem. Clarify the parts that are not clear. Think of examples, including edge cases. How will you test whether the solution works? Only then think about how to solve it.

When solving a problem, **proceed systematically**. If the problem and/or solution is complex, break it up into smaller chunks that can be tackled one after the other. When implementing a solution, do one thing at a time. Test each step and refine it as required.

Start with the simplest way to solve the problem. Once it works, refactor and extend the solution.

There’s no need to look clever. It’s far more important to **strive for clarity**. A method should do one thing and this one thing should be clear from its name. Keep in mind that you are writing code not only for the machine to execute but also for humans to read, maintain, and extend.

# Rule \#2: Always know what you're doing. Always know what your code is doing.

**Always know what you’re doing**. You never want to get into _hack & slash mode,_ just trying whatever comes to your mind, hoping it will work. Instead develop and follow a systematic approach. In particular:

* Take small steps and run your code often and as soon as possible.
* Include examples and test cases right from the beginning.
* If not sure, look up the documentation and verify behaviour and expected results. **Always know what your code is doing.**

Never skip writing **tests and documentation.** With each program you write, practice it until it becomes second nature.

# Rule \#3: Wherever you go, show up prepared.
