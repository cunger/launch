# Dear past self,

Thanks a lot, this is was indeed helpful.

I’m not allowed to tell you about the future. But I remember you read David Siegel and he said: “If we win, our future will be so bright we’ll have to wear shades.”

So keep going! And remember: It's about the shape, not the time you arrive in.
