There's so much good stuff when working through the [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) curriculum that it would be a pity to forget all of it. These notes collect the bare essentials I want to remember. They are like the slime trail of a snail, sticky remainders of the slow but steady path to a future full of code.

* [Ruby Kernel Panic](https://github.com/cunger/launch/tree/master/notes/ruby-kernel-panic): Basics of Ruby and OOP

* [Beyond Lies the Wub](https://github.com/cunger/launch/tree/master/notes/beyond-lies-the-wub): Fundamentals of web development

* [Los Postres](https://github.com/cunger/launch/tree/master/notes/los-postres): SQL and relational databases

* [All style before content](https://github.com/cunger/launch/tree/master/notes/style-before-content): HTML and CSS

As well as some extra-curricular stuff:

* [Perls](https://github.com/cunger/launch/tree/master/notes/perls): Excellent books compressed in small shiny perls
