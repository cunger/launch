Tests serve three purposes:
* Design guidance
* Safety net (finding bugs and changes that break the application)
* Documentation

Test-driven development combines testing, specification, and design into one holistic activity.

TDD cycle:
* Write a failing test
* Make the diagnostics clear
* Make the test pass
* Refactor
