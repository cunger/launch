HTML = content (information + structure)
CSS = appearance of that content

the basic building block is the _element_

> Every element in web design is a rectangular box.

root element: `html`

## Block vs inline elements

Default way of creating elements without any further semantics:
* `div`  for block elements
* `span` for inline elements

##

Each HTML element can have a `class` attribute and an `id` attribute.
