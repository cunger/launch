## Markup

* Link logo to home.
* Put logo in an `h1` if appropriate.
* Put `img` in a `figure` if appropriate.
* When an image doesn't carry any semantics, it's best placed as `no-repeat` background image.
* Add `time` tag to dates and date times.

## Styling

* When you have a background image (e.g. in a header), specify a suitable background color as well, so text will be visible also when the image is not loaded.
