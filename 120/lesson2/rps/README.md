A **game** has exactly two **player**s, a human and the computer, and consists of a sequence of **rounds**
that are played until one of the players has won 3 rounds.

Each player has a _name_, a _score_, and a _memory_ that allows him to remember the rounds played so far.

Each round lets both players make their **move**, and then determines the winner according to the rules.

The computer additionally has a **strategy** that determines how he chooses his move (currently _random_).
