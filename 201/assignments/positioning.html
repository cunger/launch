        Ensign Babyface! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. The unexpected is our normal routine. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Computer, lights up! I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. You enjoyed that. Computer, belay that order. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I am your worst nightmare! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence.

        I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Your head is not an artifact! And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Ensign Babyface!
