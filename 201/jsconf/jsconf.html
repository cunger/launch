              <p>
                Gregor is a full stack developer &amp; UX designer, questioning the status quo of what's possible in the browser today. He created minutes.io and Hoodie, a JavaScript Library/Architecture that enables you to build offline-capable applications without ever thinking about the backend.
              </p>
              <p>
                He's a founder at The Hoodie Firm, where he tries to figure out how to fund the “Hoodie” Open Source project without selling his soul. He lives with his wife in Zurich, but sometimes he's off and on the road to just another AfricaHackTrip.

              <h3>Eduardo Shiota</h3>
              <p>
                I'm a front-end engineer and designer, who moved from the land of samba to the land of bicycles. Started developing pages in 1998, have been working with web development since 2002 and with design since 2005. I'm fluent in HTML, CSS and JavaScript development and hack my way through Ruby and PHP whenever needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I graduated in Arts, so I also have skills in print, type, and web design. My main design skill is crafting engaging and optimal User Experience, applying Information Architecture and User-Centered Design concepts.
