          This should be interesting. The unexpected is our normal routine. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. What? We're not at all alike! I'll alert the crew.
          Shields up! Rrrrred alert! The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere!

        <h3>Admiral Kerning</h3>

        <p>
           The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I've had twelve years to think about it. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Besides, you look good in a dress.
