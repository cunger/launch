        Computer, lights up!
        Talk about going nowhere fast. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone.

        Sorry, Data. I'll be sure to note that in my log. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. The unexpected is our normal routine.

        Shields up! Rrrrred alert! You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers.
