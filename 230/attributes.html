    <h1>On the River</h1>
    <p>A poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar</p>

    <p>
      The sun is low,<br>
      The waters flow,<br>
      My boat is dancing to and fro.<br>
      The eve is still,<br>
      Yet from the hill<br>
      The killdeer echoes loud and shrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paddles plash,<br>
      The wavelets dash,<br>
      We see the summer lightning flash;<br>
      While now and then,<br>
      In marsh and fen<br>
      Too muddy for the feet of men,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where neither bird<br>
      Nor beast has stirred,<br>
      The spotted bullfrog's croak is heard.<br>
      The wind is high,<br>
      The grasses sigh,<br>
      The sluggish stream goes sobbing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      And far away<br>
      The dying day<br>
      Has cast its last effulgent ray;<br>
      While on the land<br>
      The shadows stand<br>
      Proclaiming that the eve's at hand.
    </p>
